# Instructions for Assignment 9 submission 

***PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!!!!***

1) We are on week 14. The last week of this class and for the year. Celebrate. You made it!!!!!!

2) I thought of this so much. Look, the reality is that I don't want to beat you up and in the last week of school. It's time for you all to start winding down. 

3) So what will happen with assignment 9?   this is the part I need you to read very very carefully...

- The assignment is to create a face mask detection system. An example of the expectation is this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax6P93r32KU

- If you choose NOT to work on it, I will consider your assignment 9 grade 100%, effectively you have the option of not submitting this assignment and call it quits for the year if you have submitted everything else. 

- If you choose to submitt the assignment here is what will happen and what I need from you:

3.1) The submission will have to be a video clip of under 30 seconds of you showing how you put in the mask and remove it and your ML detecting so. Just like in the video link shared above. If it works, then you get 100%, if not, 0%. That's it. It's a binary grade, all or nothing. If you choose to take on this challenge and submit, then email me with details for me to get to your video in case that you chose to post in an external cloud storage. 

3.2) Submission of the video has to be done by this Friday at midnight (into saturday).

3.3) If you get 100% I will use that to replace the score of your lowest scored assignment except the Capstone Project. So if you have scored low in a previous assignment and you want the chance to up that grade to 100%, this is your chance. If in the contrary you have done well in all assignments until now then you can seat this one out, or email me, I will read a proposal for extra points if you have one.

That's it!   I don't care how you get it done. I don't care that you refactor code you found. By now you have enough of knowledge to at least understand how the system in priciple works and if you want to truly challenge yourself try and do it all from scratch, or simply look for many examples out on the internet and adapt it. Remember I will grate this binarily, it either works or not. I want to hear you say in your video "Professor Sanchez, I have a mask, and now I don't have a mask".

WHO IS UP FOR THE CHALLENGE?!?!?!?!?!
